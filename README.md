# Astrotracker

Astrotracker is a Python-based tool for astronomical event tracking and visualisation.  
It provides an interactive interface to compute, plot, and analyse celestial positions of Sun, Moon, planets, and stars
using PyQt6 and Plotly.

---

## How It Works

Astrotracker contains a default database of celestial objects and cities. This DB can be expanded, and other stars
and cities can be added.

By selecting the requested celestial object, city, and date, it is possible to track the object trajectory.
Several graphs are available, both in Azimuth / Altitude and Equatorial coordinates.

It is also possible to save the results in a .CSV file.
